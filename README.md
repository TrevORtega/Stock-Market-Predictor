# Stock-Market-Predictor
This is my first programming project I created my first quarter of college freshman year, so take the programming conventions with a grain of salt.

This Program predicts the price of the Dow Jones at any given time in history after 1915. 
  If given a specific date, the program will display the price of the market at that time.
  If given a specific price, the program will display the date at which that price will occur.
  
In order to make it's calculations, the program uses a sinusoidal linear regression that is supposed to model the rise and fall of the market.

TO USE:
1. Clone repository
2. Run the python file (There is only 1)
